# snake
Snake is a casual game where a sole player attempts to eat food (represented in shapes/object) by running into them with the head of the snake. Each object eaten makes the snake longer, so maneuvering is progressively more difficult. The concept of the game originated from the 1976 arcade game Blockade.
