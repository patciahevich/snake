## Project Description  
This project was created as part of the **"Frontend Developer"** course by Rolling Scopes School. The main goal was to develop a classic Snake game while learning to use the `<canvas>` element for drawing and implementing game logic with JavaScript.

## Project Goals  
- Learn the basics of the `<canvas>` element and its API.  
- Develop a functional game loop for real-time updates.  
- Practice working with JavaScript to handle game logic and user interactions.  
- Create a simple and visually appealing game interface.  

## Key Skills Learned  
- Drawing shapes and objects on the `<canvas>` element using its 2D context.  
- Implementing game mechanics such as movement, collision detection, and scoring.  
- Using JavaScript to create a responsive game loop with `requestAnimationFrame()`.  
- Structuring and organizing code for better readability and maintainability.  
- Adding interactivity, such as keyboard controls, for enhanced user experience.  

## Features  
- A functional Snake game where the snake grows as it eats food.  
- Real-time gameplay with smooth animations.  
- Collision detection to handle game over scenarios.  
- A simple and clean interface with a scoring system.  
- Keyboard controls for intuitive gameplay.  

This project provided valuable experience with the `<canvas>` element and helped me improve my understanding of game development fundamentals and JavaScript.
